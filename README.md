# CSS day-ta Hackathon

## Description

We created a website featuring data from the past 10 years of CSS Day for its 10th anniversary. This project was developed during a 3.5-day hackathon where we competed against other groups. Our website had to be accessible and needed to have progressive enhancement. The judges were Peter Paul Koch and Krijn Hoetmer. Ultimately, our team won the hackathon, earning free tickets to CSS Day along with another group.

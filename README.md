## Description

"We created a website featuring data from the past 10 years of CSS Day to commemorate its 10th anniversary. This project was developed during a 3.5-day hackathon where we competed against other groups. The judges were Peter Paul Koch and Krijn Hoetmer. Ultimately, our team won the hackathon, earning a free ticket to CSS Day along with another group."
